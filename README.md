It follows the story of Tsuneo, a university student who becomes the caregiver of Josee, a young paraplegic woman. As the two spend more time together, a beautiful friendship flourishes and Tsuneo helps Josee discover the world outside her own home.
   
2. I want to eat your pancreas - I Want to Eat Your Pancreas is a beautiful and moving exploration of what it means to truly live, told through the perspective of an emotionally distant boy whose life is changed by a terminally ill girl. The film deals with a girl with a terminal illness, a boy who keeps her secret, and the unnamed relationship they create. Sakura enlists Haruki to help her check items off her bucket list and they gradually grow closer. As the anime progresses, Haruki gives Sakura what she needs – a peer aware of her situation – while Sakura in turn encourages Haruki to come out of his shell and appreciate life.
   
3. A silent voice - A Silent Voice is a film that explores the themes of bullying, disability, forgiveness, mental health, suicide, and friendship. It tells the story of a former bully who tries to make amends with the deaf girl he had tormented in elementary school12.
